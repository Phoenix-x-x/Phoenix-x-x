I'm a firefighter from the UK who's learning how to program in his free time.
Currently working my way through the curriculum on https://freecodecamp.org/
Starting the end of unit projects on Responsive web design
Hoping to add JS and Python to my stack in the near future.

Feel free to connect ^_^
